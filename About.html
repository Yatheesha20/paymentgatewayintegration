<h1 style="color:lightpink"><font face="algerian">DONATE BOOKS</font></h1>
</center>
<h3><i>Donating to the needy is a great way to improve the conditions in your neighborhood or community.Many students consider study as a burden for them. They hate books and do not even know the worth of books. What is the importance of books and school should be asked by the children who cannot go to school because their parents do not have sufficient money to buy them books. Even if they want to study, they do not get a chance to do so. We on the other hand, just want to get rid of books some times. Thus when your academic session is over, instead of giving away your books back to the shopkeeper, or to throw them away, donate them, give them to ones who really want to study hard, but do not have any option to do so.</h3><br>

<h2>Education Gives Ability to Read & Write:</h2><br>
<h3>“A man without education is like a building without foundation.”<br>

Education helps a person to be able to read and write. Most of the information is communicated by writing. A man who has this ability to read is called a literate.<br>

He can read books, newspapers, signs, and symbols. It also helps to read signboards in the street, at shops, bus, train and air stations. It also helps them in their day to day activities like banking, shopping, money transaction and many more.<br>
